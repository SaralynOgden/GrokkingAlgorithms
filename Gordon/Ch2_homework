Why does array insert take O(n)? 
-	Because you have to perform an operation to shift each element after the insertion point. 
How would you insert an element at the beginning of an array? How long would it take? 
-	Create a new array to accommodate the inserted element, then shift each element one index higher. Worse case is every element requires a shift operation, so O(n). 


Exercise
2.1	Should a finance app that tracks expenses (lots of inserts, few reads) use an array or a list? List
2.2	A restaurant order queue… array or list? 
o	Inserting to last element reading from first, not random so list, insert/delete O(1).
2.3	Facebook username search… array or list? 
o	Array, since username lookup requires random access for binary searching, O(log n). List would require simple search, O(n). 
2.4	Facebook signup… array or list?
o	Arrays require inserting to maintain order, so performance hit to shift remaining elements.
o	Lists insert faster. 
2.5	Facebook hybrid data structure, an array of linked lists… faster or slower than pure array or list?
o	Compromise. Hybrid approach permits random search for beginning letter, then uses lists to accommodate inserts and deletes. Using a pure array or list affords a performance boost for some of the necessary operations but takes a hit for others.
